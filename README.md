🎓 Campus Placement ML Project  
A complete machine learning analysis covering classification, regression, and clustering on a real-world dataset from Kaggle.


📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a campus placement dataset and applies multiple machine learning techniques to:

Predict student placement status (classification)
Estimate expected salary (regression)
Identify natural student groups (clustering)

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, cleaned, transformed, and evaluated using a variety of ML models and performance metrics.


🧹 Data Preprocessing
Key preprocessing steps include:

Handling missing values
Encoding categorical features
Feature scaling
Train/test splitting
Outlier inspection
Dimensionality reduction (PCA for visualization)


📊 Visualizations
The project includes three final comparison charts summarizing model performance:

Classification Models – Radar Chart (Accuracy)
Regression Models – Heatmap (R² Score)
Clustering Models – Heatmap (Silhouette Score)

These visualizations provide a clear and concise comparison of the best-performing models in each category.
